## Cards

> Cards are the foundation of a deck, you need them to be able play the game. Each card has individual abilites and are important for desiging the deck.
> There are many types of cards: Creatures, Instants, Sorceries, Enchantments, Artifacts, and Lands. The type of card determines what they do and when they can be played.
> Cards can be added to your decks and your sideboards, but must be removed from the deck/sideboard before you try to delete them.


##Decks

> There are many types of decks that are used depending on the type of format you are playing. In this project, I only alloted options for Standard, Modern, Legacy, and Commander.
> Commander decks have 100 cards in them; 1 card is the commander and determines what cards are allowed to be in the deck. So you have 1 commander and 99 cards in the deck.
> I haven't added a way to do it but it's possible to have 2 partnered commanders and 98 cards in your deck. 
> The commander starts in a separate area called the commandzone. Companions are cards that say they can be companions as long as the deck you are playing meets the specifications.
> Legacy, Modern, and Standard are all 60 card minimum formats. Your deck can have any number of cards as long as that number is equal to or greater than 60.
> The difference between these three decks is what cards are legal in them. When in doubt using [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) or [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) to check the legality of a card for your deck.

##Sideboard

> Sideboards are almost like a mini deck. A lot of tournaments and Friday Night Magic events are best of 3 rounds. So you bring a deck with a sideboard for that deck. 
> What that means is if you run into an opponent with a deck you don't have an answer for in your main deck and lose game 1, you can switch cards out of your deck with cards in your sideboard to help you win game 2.
> Pretty much all constructed formats allow you to have a 15 card sideboard brought along with your deck. 
> Commander is a lot different in the sense that technically you aren't allowed to have sideboard for the deck. I allowed users in this project to have a sideboard for their commander deck as a maybeboard.
> Maybeboards are like hey I think I want to put this card into the deck but I'm not sure if there's something I can take out of the deck for it.
